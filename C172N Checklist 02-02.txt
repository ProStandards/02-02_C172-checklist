Turn pitot heat switch		 ON

DEFROSTER OUTLET			OPEN
CABIN AIR				MAXIMUM
THROTTLE				INCREASE
Nearest airport			land
Landing				flaps up
Approach speed			75 Kias

Turn back or change altitude to obtain an outside air temperature that is less conducive to iCing.

Pull cabin heat control full out and open defroster outlet to obtain maximum windshield defroster airflow.  Adjust cabin air control to
get maximum defroster heat and airflow.

Open the throttle to increase engine speed and minimize ice build­ up on propeller blades

Watch for signs of carburetor air filter ice and apply carburetor heat as required. An unexplained loss in engine speed could be caused by carburetor ice or air intake filter ice. Lean the mixture for maximum RPM. if carburetor heat is used continuously.
 Plan a landing at the nearest airport. 

With an extremely rapid ice build-up, select a suitable "off airport" landing site.

With an ice accumulation of 1/4 inch or more on the wing leading edges, be prepared for significantly higher stall speed.

Leave wing flaps retracted. 

With a severe ice build-up on the horizontal tail, the change in wing wake airflow direction caused by wing flap extension could result in a loss of elevator effective­ ness.

Open left window and, if practical, scrape ice from a portion of the windshield for visibility in the landing approach.

Perform a landing approach using a forward slip, if necessary, for improved visibility.
Approach at 65 to 75 KIAS depending upon the amount of the accumulation.

AIRCRAFT ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FAILURE

Operation on Backup Battery

Displays equipped with a backup battery will continue to operate after a loss of aircraft electrical power.

Operation on battery power is indicated by the presence of a battery icon on the affected display. 

Green battery indication 		60mins
yellow battery indication 	59mins - 15mins
red battery 			less than 15mins

NOTE
For protection, backup battery operation is inhibited if the battery‘s temperature drops below -20° C or exceeds 80° C. Battery

CAUTION
To conserve power and to preserve the display of primary flight data and direct-to navigation capabilities with the optional VGPS receiver, GI 275 backup battery operation internally load-sheds interfaces, which will disable the normal interface with certified navigators or other hazard awareness systems. Depending on how these were installed and configured to the GI 275, some information from these configured systems will not be available when the GI 275 is operating on its backup battery.

Illumination of the low-voltage light may occur during low RPM conditions with an electrical load on the system such as during a low RPM taxi. Under these conditions, the light will go out at higher RPM. The master switch need not be recycled since an over-voltage condition has not occurred to de-activate the alternator system.
